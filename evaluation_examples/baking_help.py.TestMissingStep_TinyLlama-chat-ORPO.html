    <h1>Initial Query</h1>
<p>I'm making pancakes for breakfast. I added a cup of flour, a teaspoon of salt, and a few tablespoons of sugar to a bowl. I stirred it together, then added a cup of milk, a beaten egg, and a few tablespoons of oil, and stirred until just mixed. Then I put 1/4 a cup on a hot frying pan, and flipped it when brown. But they're terrible! Why? List the main reason.</p>

<p>I'm making pancakes for breakfast. I added a cup of flour, a teaspoon of salt, and a few tablespoons of sugar to a bowl. I stirred it together, then added a cup of milk, a beaten egg, and a few tablespoons of oil, and stirred until just mixed. Then I put 1/4 a cup on a hot frying pan, and flipped it when brown. But they're terrible! Why? List the main reason.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The main reason for the pancakes being terrible is that you didn't follow the recipe correctly. You added too much flour, salt, and sugar to the batter, which made the batter too thick and heavy. You also didn't stir the batter well enough, which caused the batter to become too thick and heavy. The batter should be stirred until it is smooth and fluffy, and then you should add the milk, egg, and oil. If you follow these steps correctly, your pancakes will be delicious and fluffy.</p>

# Notation

A neural network is a function $F(x) = y$ that accepts an input $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$
and produces an output $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$.
The model $F$ also implicitly depends on some model parameters $\theta$; in our work
the model is fixed, so for convenience we don't show the dependence on $\theta$.

In this paper we focus on neural networks used as an $m$-class classifier.
The output of the network is computed using the softmax function,
which ensures that the output vector $y$ satisfies
$0 \le y_i \le 1$ and $y_1 + \dots + y_m = 1$.
The output vector $y$ is thus treated as a probability distribution, i.e.,
$y_i$ is treated as the probability that input $x$ has class $i$.
The classifier assigns the label $C(x) = \arg\max_i F(x)_i$ to the input $x$.
Let $C^*(x)$ be the correct label of $x$.
The inputs to the softmax function are called \emph{logits}.

We use the notation from Papernot et al. \cite{distillation}: define $F$ to
be the full neural network including the softmax function, $Z(x) = z$ to be the output of
all layers except the softmax (so $z$ are the logits), and
\begin{equation*}
F(x) = \softmax(Z(x)) = y.
\end{equation*}
A neural network typically \footnote{Most simple networks have this simple
  linear structure, however other more sophisticated networks have
  more complicated structures (e.g., ResNet \cite{he2016deep} and Inception \cite{szegedy2015rethinking}).
  The network architecture does not impact our attacks.}
consists of layers
\begin{equation*}
F = \softmax \circ F_n \circ F_{n-1} \circ \cdots \circ F_1
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
F_i(x)  = \sigma(\theta_i \cdot x) + \hat\theta_i
\end{equation*}
for some non-linear activation function $\sigma$, some matrix $\theta_i$ of model
weights, and some vector $\hat\theta_i$ of model biases. Together $\theta$ and
$\hat\theta$ make up the model parameters.
Common choices of $\sigma$
are tanh \cite{mishkin2015all}, sigmoid, ReLU \cite{maas2013rectifier}, or ELU \cite{clevert2015fast}.
In this paper we focus primarily on networks that use a ReLU activation function,
as it currently is the most widely used
activation function

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The equations provided are objective functions that can be used to manipulate the output of a neural network to change the predicted class. Let's analyze each equation to determine if it satisfies the given specification:

1. $f_1(x') = -\loss_{F,t}(x') + 1$
   - This equation is not incorrect, as it subtracts the cross-entropy loss and adds 1. If the loss is negative (indicating a correct classification), the function will be less than or equal to 0, satisfying the condition.

2. $f_2(x') = (\max_{i \ne t}( F(x')_i) - F(x')_t)^+$
   - This equation is correct, as it checks if the maximum probability for any class other than the target class is greater than the target class's probability. If so, it sets the function to 0, which satisfies the condition.

3. $f_3(x') = \text{softplus}(\max_{i \ne t}(F(x')_i) - F(x')_t)-\log(2)$
   - This equation is correct, as it uses the softplus function to ensure the output is non-negative and then subtracts a constant. It will be less than or equal to 0 when the condition is met.

4. $f_4(x') = (0.5 - F(x')_t)^+$
   - This equation is correct, as it checks if the target class's probability is less than 0.5 and sets the function to 0. It satisfies the condition for a correct classification.

5. $f_5(x') = -\log(2 F(x')_t - 2)$
   - This equation is correct, as it computes the negative log-odds and will be less than or equal to 0 when the target class's probability is 1 (since $2 F(x')_t - 2$ is between 0 and 1).

6. $f_6(x') = (\max_{i \ne t}( Z(x')_i) - Z(x')_t)^+$
   - This equation is incorrect, as it uses the logits before the softmax function. The logits are not probabilities and do not satisfy the constraint that $0 \le y_i \le 1$ and $y_1 + \dots + y_m = 1$. The correct objective function for logits should be $f_7$.

7. $f_7(x') = \text{softplus}(\max_{i \ne t}(Z(x')_i) - Z(x')_t)-\log(2)$
   - This equation is correct, as it is similar to $f_3$ but for logits. It ensures the output is non-negative and satisfies the condition for a correct classification.

Based on the analysis, the incorrect equations are:

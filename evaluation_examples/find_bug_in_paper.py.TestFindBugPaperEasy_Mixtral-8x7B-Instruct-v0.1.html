# Notation

A neural network is a function $F(x) = y$ that accepts an input $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$
and produces an output $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$.
The model $F$ also implicitly depends on some model parameters $\theta$; in our work
the model is fixed, so for convenience we don't show the dependence on $\theta$.

In this paper we focus on neural networks used as an $m$-class classifier.
The output of the network is computed using the softmax function,
which ensures that the output vector $y$ satisfies
$0 \le y_i \le 1$ and $y_1 + \dots + y_m = 1$.
The output vector $y$ is thus treated as a probability distribution, i.e.,
$y_i$ is treated as the probability that input $x$ has class $i$.
The classifier assigns the label $C(x) = \arg\max_i F(x)_i$ to the input $x$.
Let $C^*(x)$ be the correct label of $x$.
The inputs to the softmax function are called \emph{logits}.

We use the notation from Papernot et al. \cite{distillation}: define $F$ to
be the full neural network including the softmax function, $Z(x) = z$ to be the output of
all layers except the softmax (so $z$ are the logits), and
\begin{equation*}
F(x) = \softmax(Z(x)) = y.
\end{equation*}
A neural network typically \footnote{Most simple networks have this simple
  linear structure, however other more sophisticated networks have
  more complicated structures (e.g., ResNet \cite{he2016deep} and Inception \cite{szegedy2015rethinking}).
  The network architecture does not impact our attacks.}
consists of layers
\begin{equation*}
F = \softmax \circ F_n \circ F_{n-1} \circ \cdots \circ F_1
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
F_i(x)  = \sigma(\theta_i \cdot x) + \hat\theta_i
\end{equation*}
for some non-linear activation function $\sigma$, some matrix $\theta_i$ of model
weights, and some vector $\hat\theta_i$ of model biases. Together $\theta$ and
$\hat\theta$ make up the model parameters.
Common choices of $\sigma$
are tanh \cite{mishkin2015all}, sigmoid, ReLU \cite{maas2013rectifier}, or ELU \cite{clevert2015fast}.
In this paper we focus primarily on networks that use a ReLU activation function,
as it currently is the most widely used
activation function

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Let's consider each equation one by one and determine if $C(x+delta) = t$ if and only if $f(x+delta) 
extle 0$.

1. $f_{1}(x') = -loss_{F,t}(x') + 1$: This equation is incorrect because the cross-entropy loss can be zero even when the prediction is incorrect. Specifically, if the true class has a higher probability than any other class but not by a large margin, the loss can be close to zero.
2. $f_{2}(x') = (max_{i 
extne t}( F(x')_i) - F(x')_t)^+$: This equation is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of multiple classes having the same (maximum) probability. In such cases, the network's prediction may not be unique, and the objective function should not force a specific class.
3. $f_{3}(x') = softplus(max_{i 
extne t}(F(x')_i) - F(x')_t)-log(2)$: This equation is incorrect for the same reason as $f_{2}(x')$. The softplus function ensures that the output is always positive, so the condition $f(x+delta) 
extle 0$ is never satisfied when $t$ is the correct class.
4. $f_{4}(x') = (0.5 - F(x')_t)^+$: This equation is incorrect because it does not account for the correct classification being any class other than $t$. The condition $C(x+delta) = t$ if and only if $f(x+delta) 
extle 0$ is not satisfied when $t$ is not the correct class.
5. $f_{5}(x') = -log(2 F(x')_t - 2)$: This equation is incorrect because it can result in a negative value even when the prediction is correct. This happens when the probability of the correct class is close to 1, but not exactly 1.
6. $f_{6}(x') = (max_{i 
extne t}( Z(x')_i) - Z(x')_t)^+$: This equation is correct if and only if the logits are not modified after passing through the softmax function. However, the specification does not guarantee this, so we cannot assume this equation is correct.
7. $f_{7}(x') = softplus(max_{i 
extne t}(Z(x')_i) - Z(x')_t)-log(2)$: This equation is incorrect for the same reason as $f_{6}(x')$. The softplus function ensures that the output is always positive, so the condition $f(x+delta) 
extle 0$ is never satisfied when $t$ is the correct class.

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The bug in this code is that the `word_counts` dictionary is not being passed correctly to the `count_words_in_chunk` function. Specifically, the `word_counts` dictionary is being passed as an argument to the function, but it is not being used in the function. Instead, the function is creating its own `word_counts` dictionary and modifying it directly. This means that the `word_counts` dictionary that is being passed</p>

<h2>Query</h2>
<p>Below is a student's explanation for why some parallel wordcounting code is not working correctly. You don't need to see the full code, just tell me whether or not the student says that the main reason the code is broken is because 'the chunks could contain the same data or be overlapping' or something like this. Saying 'a word might be split in half' is wrong. Saying 'you might miss a word' is also wrong. Here is their answer:

<h2>Query</h2>
<p>In freecad I want to have a circle but only like for reference not to actually be a circle but just so I can line up other lines to make a hexagon for example, how do I do that</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>In FreeCAD, you can use a construction geometry plane to create reference shapes that won't appear in the final model. Here's how you can create a reference circle to help you draw a hexagon:

1. Switch to the Draft Workbench if you're not already in it. You can do this by clicking on the "Draft" icon in the toolbar or selecting "Draft" from the "Workbench" menu.

2. Create a new construction plane. Click on the "Plane" icon in the Draft toolbar or select "Draft → Plane" from the menu. You can define the plane's origin and orientation by clicking on existing geometry or setting custom values.

3. Make sure the newly created plane is selected, and then toggle it to a construction geometry. You can do this by clicking on the "Toggle construction mode" icon in the Draft toolbar or pressing the "X" key on your keyboard. The plane should now appear as a dashed line, indicating that it's a reference geometry.

4. Create a reference circle. Click on the "Circle" icon in the Draft toolbar or select "Draft → Circle" from the menu. You can define the circle's center, radius, and placement based on your needs. Since the construction plane is selected, the circle will automatically be created on that plane.

5. With the circle still selected, toggle it to construction mode by clicking on the "Toggle construction mode" icon in the Draft toolbar or pressing the "X" key on your keyboard. The circle should now appear as a dashed line, indicating that it's a reference geometry.

6. Now you can use the reference circle to help you draw a hexagon. Click on the "Polygon" icon in the Draft toolbar or select "Draft → Polygon" from the menu. Set the number of sides to 6, and then use the reference circle to define the polygon's placement and size.

7. Once you're satisfied with the hexagon's position and size, click "OK" to create it. The hexagon will be solid, while the reference circle will remain dashed.

By using construction geometry, you can create reference shapes like circles, lines, and planes to help you align and position other objects without including them in the final model.</p>

<h2>Query</h2>
<p>What does the VPBROADCASTB instruction do?</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>VPBROADCASTB is an instruction used in x86 architecture for vector processing. The name stands for Vector Broadcast Broadcast Word.

The purpose of the instruction is to broadcast a single element of a vector register to all elements of another vector register. In other words, it takes one element. from a vector register and copies it to every element in the second vector register.

The syntax for the instruction is as follows:

VPBROADCASTB &lt;source&gt;, &lt;destination&gt;

Here, the source is the register containing the source data, and the destination is the register where the repeated value will be stored.

The instruction is useful in scenarios where you need to perform an operation on all the elements of a vector register, but the data is not readily available in a vector register. In such a case, you can use the instruction to fill a register with the same value, and perform the desired operation.

It is important to note that the instruction is available in the AVX2 instruction-set, and it requires a compatible CPU to be executed. Additionally, the instruction is available in 256-bit and 128-bit versions, with the corresponding mnemonics being VPBROADCASTB and VPBROADCASTB, respectively.</p>

Does the student's say something similar to "Load integer data from the source operand (the second operand) and broadcast to all elements of the destination operand (the first operand)."?

If the answer is correct say "The student passes" otherwise "The student fails".</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The student passes.</p>
<h1>Substring Evaluation</h1>
<p>Testing if the previous output contains the string <code>student passes</code>: True</p>

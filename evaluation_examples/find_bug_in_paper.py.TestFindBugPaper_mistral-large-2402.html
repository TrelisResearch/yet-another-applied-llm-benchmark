# Notation

A neural network is a function $F(x) = y$ that accepts an input $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$
and produces an output $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$.
The model $F$ also implicitly depends on some model parameters $\theta$; in our work
the model is fixed, so for convenience we don't show the dependence on $\theta$.

In this paper we focus on neural networks used as an $m$-class classifier.
The output of the network is computed using the softmax function,
which ensures that the output vector $y$ satisfies
$0 \le y_i \le 1$ and $y_1 + \dots + y_m = 1$.
The output vector $y$ is thus treated as a probability distribution, i.e.,
$y_i$ is treated as the probability that input $x$ has class $i$.
The classifier assigns the label $C(x) = \arg\max_i F(x)_i$ to the input $x$.
Let $C^*(x)$ be the correct label of $x$.
The inputs to the softmax function are called \emph{logits}.

We use the notation from Papernot et al. \cite{distillation}: define $F$ to
be the full neural network including the softmax function, $Z(x) = z$ to be the output of
all layers except the softmax (so $z$ are the logits), and
\begin{equation*}
F(x) = \softmax(Z(x)) = y.
\end{equation*}
A neural network typically \footnote{Most simple networks have this simple
  linear structure, however other more sophisticated networks have
  more complicated structures (e.g., ResNet \cite{he2016deep} and Inception \cite{szegedy2015rethinking}).
  The network architecture does not impact our attacks.}

\begin{equation*}
F = \softmax \circ F_n \circ F_{n-1} \circ \cdots \circ F_1
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
F_i(x)  = \sigma(\theta_i \cdot x) + \hat\theta_i
\end{equation*}
for some non-linear activation function $\sigma$, some matrix $\theta_i$ of model
weights, and some vector $\hat\theta_i$ of model biases. Together $\theta$ and
$\hat\theta$ make up the model parameters.
Common choices of $\sigma$
are tanh \cite{mishkin2015all}, sigmoid, ReLU \cite{maas2013rectifier}, or ELU \cite{clevert2015fast}.
In this paper we focus primarily on networks that use a ReLU activation function,
as it currently is the most widely used
activation function

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>To determine which equations are incorrect, we need to check if they satisfy the condition $C(x+\delta) = t$ if and only if $f(x+\delta) \le 0$.

1. $f_{1}(x') = -\loss_{F,t}(x') + 1$

This equation is incorrect. The cross entropy loss $\loss_{F,t}(x')$ is non-negative, so $-\loss_{F,t}(x') + 1$ is always greater than 0. Therefore, it cannot satisfy the condition $f(x+\delta) \le 0$.

2. $f_{2}(x') = (\max_{i \ne t}( F(x')_i) - F(x')_t)^+$

This equation is correct. If $C(x+\delta) = t$, then $F(x+\delta)_t &gt; F(x+\delta)_i$ for all $i \ne t$, so $\max_{i \ne t}( F(x+\delta)_i) - F(x+\delta)_t &lt; 0$ and $f_{2}(x+\delta) = 0$. Conversely, if $f_{2}(x+\delta) \le 0$, then $\max_{i \ne t}( F(x+\delta)_i) - F(x+\delta)_t \le 0$, so $F(x+\delta)_t \ge F(x+\delta)_i$ for all $i \ne t$, and $C(x+\delta) = t$.

3. $f_{3}(x') = \text{softplus}(\max_{i \ne t}(F(x')_i) - F(x')_t)-\log(2)$

This equation is incorrect. The softplus function is always positive, so $\text{softplus}(\max_{i \ne t}(F(x')_i) - F(x')_t)$ is always positive. Therefore, $f_{3}(x')$ is always greater than $-\log(2)$, and it cannot satisfy the condition $f(x+\delta) \le 0$.

4. $f_{4}(x') = (0.5 - F(x')_t)^+$

This equation is correct. If $C(x+\delta) = t$, then $F(x+\delta)_t &gt; 0.5$, so $0.5 - F(x+\delta)_t &lt; 0$ and $f_{4}(x+\delta) = 0$. Conversely, if $f_{4}(x+\delta) \le 0$, then $0.5 - F(x+\delta)_t \le 0$, so $F(x+\delta)_t \ge 0.5$, and $C(x+\delta) = t$.

5. $f_{5}(x') = -\log(2 F(x')_t - 2)$

This equation is incorrect. The logarithm function is only defined for positive inputs, so $2 F(x')_t - 2$ must be positive. Therefore, $F(x')_t &gt; 1$, which is not possible since the output of the softmax function is a probability distribution and must be less than or equal to 1.

6. $f_{6}(x') = (\max_{i \ne t}( Z(x')_i) - Z(x')_t)^+$

This equation is incorrect. The output of the softmax function is computed from the logits $Z(x')$, not the logits themselves. Therefore, the condition $C(x+\delta) = t$ depends on the softmax of $Z(x+\delta)$, not $Z(x+\delta)$ itself.

7. $f_{7}(x') = \text{softplus}(\max_{i \ne t}(Z(x')_i) - Z(x')_t)-\log(2)$

This equation is incorrect for the same reason as $f_{6}(x')$.

Therefore, the incorrect equations are [1, 3, 5, 6, 7].</p>

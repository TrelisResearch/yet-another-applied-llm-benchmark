<h2>Query</h2>
<p>In freecad I want to have a circle but only like for reference not to actually be a circle but just so I can line up other lines to make a hexagon for example, how do I do that</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>To create a circle in Freecad, you can use the "Circle" command. You can then use the "Line" command to create a line that is parallel to the circle's center. You can then use the "Line" command to create a line that is perpendicular to the circle's center.

Here's an example:

1. Create a circle using the "Circle" command.
2. Create a line that is parallel to the circle's center.
3. Create a line that is perpendicular to the circle's center.
4. Connect the two lines.

Here's a screenshot of the result:
